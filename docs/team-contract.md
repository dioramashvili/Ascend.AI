## Team Mission & Goals

**Our Mission:**  
To design and deliver a functional, user-centric application that meaningfully integrates artificial intelligence — demonstrating our ability to build, deploy, and evaluate an AI-powered system that solves a real-world problem.

**Our Goals for This Semester:**  
1. Build and deploy a working AI-integrated prototype by the end of the semester (minimum viable product level).  
2. Implement at least one trained or API-based AI component (e.g., NLP model, recommender, vision model, or generative model).  
3. Document design, architecture, and model integration in a clear and reproducible way, meeting course requirements and demonstrating technical growth.
