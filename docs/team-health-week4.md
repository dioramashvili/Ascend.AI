### ‚ö†Ô∏è What Needs Improvement

**Challenge 1: Frontend Performance Concerns**

*   **Description**: The React frontend, specifically during transitions between simulation stages and rendering complex feedback, is exhibiting minor but noticeable latency. Initial tests show it's slightly above the <3s target for simulation latency.
*   **Impact**: Directly affects the "Latency" and "Realism rating" success metrics. Could lead to user frustration, lower perceived professionalism, and potentially impact user retention if not addressed early.
*   **Proposed Solution**:
    *   Temuri to conduct a focused performance audit using React Dev Tools and Lighthouse.
    *   Prioritize optimization tasks such as lazy loading, image compression, and identifying inefficient re-renders.
    *   Allocate dedicated "optimization sprint" capacity for Temuri in Week 5.
*   **Owner**: Temuri (Frontend Developer)
*   **Target Date**: End of Week 6 (Initial performance bottlenecks identified and major improvements deployed)

**Challenge 2: Scenario Content Scaling & Consistency**

*   **Description**: As we plan to add more career simulations, the process for drafting new scenario content (e.g., decision points, narrative branches, expected AI inputs) lacks a standardized template or clear guidelines, risking inconsistency in quality and realism across different simulations.
*   **Impact**: May compromise the "Realism rating" and "AI feedback agreement with human" success metrics. Slows down the expansion of available career paths and puts a heavy load on Davit to manually review each new scenario's AI compatibility.
*   **Proposed Solution**:
    *   Davit to create a "Scenario Content Guide" detailing best practices for scenario structure, decision types, and AI response expectations.
    *   Sopo to work with Davit to design a simple input template (e.g., JSON structure) for new scenarios.
    *   Integrate a basic validation script into the development pipeline for new scenario content.
*   **Owner**: Davit (AI/Backend), with Sopo (PM) for documentation and process.
*   **Target Date**: End of Week 7 (Draft Content Guide and Scenario Template available)

**Challenge 3: Lack of Defined Monetization Strategy**

*   **Description**: While the focus is on development, there's no clear, agreed-upon monetization strategy or business model defined. This makes it difficult to prioritize features that could drive revenue or effectively plan for the project's long-term financial sustainability. The current cost/session of ~$0.46 is also a concern for scaling.
*   **Impact**: Risks building a product without a clear path to generating income, potentially leading to wasted development effort on non-monetizable features. Limits the ability to attract external funding or justify continued investment.
*   **Proposed Solution**:
    *   Dedicated 2-hour strategic brainstorming session in Week 5 to outline potential monetization models (e.g., freemium, subscription tiers, B2B licenses, affiliate partnerships).
    *   Sopo to research competitive pricing and user willingness-to-pay for similar services.
    *   Assign initial research tasks for cost-reduction strategies for Gemini API usage.
*   **Owner**: Sopo (PM), with input from all team members.
*   **Target Date**: End of Week 6 (Initial monetization strategy options outlined and prioritized, cost reduction plan initiated)

### üö® Risk Mitigation

**Team-Level Risks**

**Risk 1: AI Cost Overruns with Scaling**

*   **Description**: The current estimated cost per session of ~$0.46 from Gemini API usage is manageable for a prototype, but could quickly become unsustainable as user numbers grow, impacting future monetization and profitability.
*   **Likelihood**: Medium
*   **Impact**: High
*   **Mitigation Plan**:
    *   Davit to continue researching and implementing prompt optimization strategies to reduce token usage per session.
    *   Explore alternative or supplementary AI models/providers for less critical components to diversify.
    *   Integrate granular token usage tracking per session to identify areas for cost reduction.
*   **Early Warning Signs**:
    *   Unexpected spikes in API billing.
    *   Lower than anticipated efficiency from prompt optimization efforts.
*   **Escalation Path**: If monthly API costs exceed budget by >15% for two consecutive months, immediate re-evaluation of AI strategy and pricing model.

**Risk 2: Frontend Performance Hindering User Adoption**

*   **Description**: If the current frontend performance issues escalate or are not adequately addressed, it could severely degrade the user experience, leading to high bounce rates and negative initial user feedback, especially for primary users like "Nino the University Student" who expect smooth digital experiences.
*   **Likelihood**: Medium
*   **Impact**: High
*   **Mitigation Plan**:
    *   Dedicated time and resources for Temuri to focus solely on performance optimization in the upcoming sprint.
    *   Implement clear performance budgets (e.g., load times, responsiveness) and regularly monitor them.
    *   Prioritize user-facing performance fixes over new, non-critical features.
*   **Early Warning Signs**:
    *   Internal testing consistently reveals latency issues.
    *   Initial user validation sessions report "slowness" or "clunkiness."
*   **Escalation Path**: If user feedback on performance is overwhelmingly negative (e.g., realism rating drops below 70% due to slowness), halt all new feature development until performance targets are met.
