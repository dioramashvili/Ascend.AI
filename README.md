## About

Ascend.AI helps travelers make the most of their journeys by intelligently expanding their planned routes.  
Users can input a trip (e.g., from Berlin to Paris) and specify how far off-route theyâ€™re willing to explore.  
The system then recommends interesting nearby attractions â€” like landmarks,historical sites, art galleries, or restaurants â€” using AI to personalize suggestions based on user interests.  
The web app is built with React and FastAPI, using Supabase for authentication and data management.
